# Problem-Solving
This repo is to serve as a guide to common problem solving patterns using various algorithms.Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the underlying pattern so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems

# Patterns:

1. **Sliding Window**
2. **Two Pointers**
3. **Fast& Slow Pointers**
4. **Merge Intervals**
5. **Cyclc Sort**
6. **In-place reversal of a Linked List**
7. **Tree Breadth First Search**
8. **Tree Depth First Search**
9. **Two Heaps**
10. **Subsets**
11. **Modifief Binary Search**
12. **Bitwise XOR**
13. **Top 'K' Elements**
14. **K-way Merge**
15. **0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic programming)**
16. **Merge Intervals**
