'''
Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Example 1:

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
Example 2:

Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5 
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target: 
   [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
   
Time complexity #
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(N∗logN). The searchPair() will take O(N)O(N). So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2)O(N∗logN+N
​2
​​ ), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2)O(N
​2
​​ ).

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.
