'''
There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each task can have some prerequisite tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. Given the number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, write a method to find the ordering of tasks we should pick to finish all tasks.

Example 1:

Input: Tasks=3, Prerequisites=[0, 1], [1, 2]
Output: [0, 1, 2]
Explanation: To execute task '1', task '0' needs to finish first. Similarly, task '1' needs to finish 
before '2' can be scheduled. A possible scheduling of tasks is: [0, 1, 2] 
Example 2:

Input: Tasks=3, Prerequisites=[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]
Output: []
Explanation: The tasks have cyclic dependency, therefore they cannot be scheduled.
Example 3:

Input: Tasks=6, Prerequisites=[2, 5], [0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 4], [3, 2], [1, 3]
Output: [0 1 4 3 2 5] 
Explanation: A possible scheduling of tasks is: [0 1 4 3 2 5] 

Time Complexity #
In step ‘d’, each vertex will become a source only once and each edge will be accessed and removed once. Therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(V+E)O(V+E), where ‘V’ is the total number of vertices and ‘E’ is the total number of edges in the graph.

Space Complexity #
The space complexity will be O(V+E)O(V+E), since we are storing all of the edges for each vertex in an adjacency list.
