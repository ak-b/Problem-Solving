'''
Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given target.
Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target=6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The numbers at index 1 and 3 add up to 6: 2+4=6

Example 2:
Input: [2, 5, 9, 11], target=11
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and 2 add up to 11: 2+9=11

Time Complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the given array.

Space Complexity #
The space complexity will also be O(N)O(N), as, in the worst case, we will be pushing ‘N’ numbers in the HashTable.
