'''
Given a set of numbers that might contain duplicates, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3, 3]
Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]
Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 3, 3]
Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3], [3,3], [1,3,3], [3,3,5], [1,5,3,3] 
Time complexity #
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles (if not duplicate) as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N)O(2
​N
​​ ) subsets, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N)O(N∗2
​N
​​ ).

Space complexity #
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since at most we will have a total of O(2^N)O(2
​N
​​ ) subsets, the space complexity of our algorithm is also O(2^N)O(2
​N
​​ ).
